The most difficult part of this project was the set up for the game window. The "draw_screen" function was most of this. I needed to look at a lot of examples and do a lot of trial and error for this part to work properly. The rest of the code was mostly problem solving and after I got the hang of the pygames methods it wasn't too difficult.

This project required me to look at a lot of examples because I had never worked with pygames, and wasn't sure of all the variables I had to account for with the display.

After completing the set up, I enjoyed coding the actual game part. It was fun to run it and find something wrong or something that could potentially go wrong, and thinking of a way to work around the error or potential error.
